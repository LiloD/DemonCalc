# DemonCalc
A Command Line Brain Teaser Game

# What's this?
This is a litte brain teaser game which is used to train short-term memory and concentration.
This game is basically a "copy" of a mini game in Nintend 3DS game `Brain Age`, but it runs in command line.

# Why this?
Cause I'm boring and I lost my copy of `Brain Age`. I really like "Demon Calculation" mini game in <<Brain Age>>, so I decide to write one just for me.

# What's in it?
It uses NCurses library to manipulate text-based command line user interface.
For more information, please check wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses

# What else?
I write the program on MAC OSX and haven't tested on other platforms.
